    As I lay perceiving an allocation of symbols arranged
    in a perseverating mannerism, I find myself wandering off in an almost willingness sub-conscious way. As if a multidimensional being were pulling strings attached to my left parietal lobe causing a force to be applied to my occipital lobe on a seemingly frictionless flat surface. The chemical reactions in my cerebrum sparked in a simultaneous jolt causing me to, through what I thought was my trustworthy occipital lobe, experience the start of my shift in awareness. My vision expanded, allowing me to see beyond the Cartesian coordinate system into a dimension that did not have light bouncing off of slowly moving energy. My immediate surroundings had no effect on what I was visually experiencing. Thus, I embarked on the internal nonphysical journey that caused the rapid combustion of my subsequent universe. Consciously allowing these occurrences to manifest through my Pineal gland, I rode the vibrations of the very strings that connect all of the sub-sets of data that compose the universe. I watched as everything in existence pulled and pushed at itself. Every single action and reaction, past, present, and future, gyrated in a harmonious collection of subjective realities. I perceived a plane of the everythingness of oneness while simultaneously experiencing the nothingness of everything. I, for a brief moment, was being split atom by atom between the contradicting poles of finite every-thingness and infinite nothingness.

    Then, seemingly as quickly as it happened, I was shoved right back into my subjective reality of 21 years, classified as Augustine Andreas born in Madrid, Spain on the tenth day of March. A fellow conscious entity, of the same species as I, had caused an allocation of vibrational entropy to swell like an ocean in my dwelling unit. I sat there, momentarily ignoring the man abrasively knocking at my door. I could tell that it was a man by the heavy and melodic mannerism he decided to use while impaling his fist against the metal exterior of the door. I thought to myself if it were a girl, she would more than likely knock less abrasively, only causing slight vibrational entropy. I sat there, with waves of sounds from the knock colliding with every single object, and tried to decipher if I had just experienced an existing universe inside of my subjective perception, or if I experienced a collective multitude of universes, all consisting of subjective perceptions. I summoned the activation energy in my brain, to manifest the motion in my legs, to stand and traverse the distance from my couch to the door. As I walked in a somewhat unwilling manner, I could not help but be almost subconsciously reverted back into the thought process of trying to decipher what I had just experienced. I saw the Persian carpet lying motionless on the ground. I walked over it and thought: I wonder if the only reason this physical object exists, here right now, in my mind, is because an organization of individual subjective universes pushing and pulling each other.
